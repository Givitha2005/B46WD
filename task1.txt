//1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Http1.1 :
Http is Hypher Text Transfer Prtotocol.The first version on http is http/1.1.
1.Http1.1 lacks in the prioritization of which the order of the content loads in the webpage.
2.It loads the resources one after other so if any of the resources cannot be loaded it blocks the whole webpage
3.The server only serves the content only when the client asks.

Http2:
Http2 was the updated version after http1.1 launched on 2015.
1.Http2 resolves the prioritization issue.It uses weighed prioritization.So it allows to decide which resources in webpage to load first.
2.It sends several streams of data at client at one once instead of sending one after another.
It uses single TCP connection to send the streams of sata at once so that no resources will be blocking.
3.The server pushes the content before the client asks. 

//2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
1.Objects is also a variable but it contains multiple values.
2.The objects are written in key value pairs and seperated by colon(key:value).
Eg:
var car = {
    name:"BMW",
    fuel:"Diesel",
    color:"Grey"
}

To add a new element:
Objectname.Objectproperty = Objectvalue

To delete an element:
delete ObjectName.Objectproperty

To acces and element:
ObjectName.Objectproperty / objectname["objectproperty"]/objectname[expression]
